## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict survival based on passenger information. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of survival rates
- Insights into passenger demographics and survival factors

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb

## Dataset
